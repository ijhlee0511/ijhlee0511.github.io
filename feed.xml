<h3 id="finite-morphisms"><strong>1. Finite Morphisms</strong></h3>

<p>Before diving into the theory of quasi-finite morphisms, we briefly recall the definition of finite morphisms in scheme theory.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Definition 1.</strong> A morphism \(f: X \to Y\) is a <strong>finite</strong> morphism of schemes if there exists a covering of \(Y\) by open affine subsets \(V_i = \Spec B_i\), such that for each \(i\), \(f^{-1}(V_i)\) is affine, equal to \(\Spec A_i\), where \(A_i\) is a \(B_i\)-algebra which is a finitely generated \(B_i\)-module.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Definition 2.</strong> A morphism of schemes \(f:X \to Y\) is <strong>affine</strong> if the inverse image of any open affine subset \(V\) of \(Y\) is an open affine subset of \(X\).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Lemma 1.</strong> A morphism \(f: X \to Y\) of schemes is finite if and only if \(f\) is affine and \(\Gamma(f^{-1}(V), \mathcal{O}_X)\) is a \(\Gamma(V,\mathcal{O}_Y)\)-algebra which is a finitely generated \(\Gamma(V,\mathcal{O}_Y)\)-module.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em> See Exercise 3.4(II) of <a class="citation" href="#Hartshorne1977">(Hartshorne 1977)</a>.$\quad\square$</p>

<p>Finite morphisms have several nice properties.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Proposition 1.</strong><br />
1. A closed immersion is finite.<br />
2. The composite of two finite morphisms is finite.<br />
3. Any base change of a finite morphism is finite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em> These reduce to statements about rings, which follow directly from standard results.
For example, for (3), reducing to the local case, we need to show the following: if a ring homomorphism \(\varphi: B \to A\) is finite, then so is the induced map \(\varphi’: B’ \to A \otimes_B B’\) for any \(B\)-algebra \(B’\). $\quad\square$</p>

<p>Furthermore, by commutative algebra, it is easy to see that every finite morphism is integral; the precise definition follows.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Definition 3.</strong> Let \(f:X \to Y\) be a morphism of schemes. We say that \(f\) is <strong>integral</strong> if \(f\) is affine and if for every affine open \(\Spec B = V \subseteq Y \) with inverse image \(\Spec A = f^{-1}(V)\subseteq X\) the associated ring map \(B \to A\) is integral.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, one of the most important properties of finite morphisms is that they are proper morphisms; that is, they behave similarly to continuous maps between compact Hausdorff spaces.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Proposition 2.</strong> Any finite morphism \(f : X \to Y\) is proper, that is, it is separated, of finite type, and universally closed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Proof.</em> It is known that every affine morphism is separated (<a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01S7">Tag 01S7</a> <a class="citation" href="#stacks-project">(The Stacks project authors 2025)</a>), so every finite morphism is automatically separated.
By the “going up” theorem, one can easily show that every integral morphism is universally closed (<a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01WM">Tag 01WM</a> <a class="citation" href="#stacks-project">(The Stacks project authors 2025)</a>).$\quad\square$</p>

<h3 id="quasi-finite-morphisms"><strong>2. Quasi-Finite Morphisms</strong></h3>

<p>In general, we denote by \(X \times_SY\) the fiber product of two \(S\)-schemes \(X\) and \(Y\). When \(S = \Spec R\) is affine, we also write \(X \times_R Y\). When \(Y = \Spec B\), instead of writing \(X \times_R Y\) we may write \(X \times_S B\); and if, in addition, \(S = \Spec R\) is affine, we write \(X \otimes_R B\).
We recall the definition of the fiber.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Definition 4.</strong> Let \(f: X \to Y\) be a morphism of schemes, and let \(y \in Y\) be a point.
Let \(k(y)\) be the residue field of \(y\), and let \(\Spec k(y) \to Y\) be the natural morphism.
Then we define the <strong>fiber</strong> of the morphism \(f\) over the point \(y\) to be the scheme
\[ X_y = X \times_Y \Spec k(y). \]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fiber \(X_y\) is a scheme over \(k(y)\), and one can show that its underlying topological space is homeomorphic to the subset \(f^{-1}(y)\) of \(X\) (Exer.3.10(II) of <a class="citation" href="#Hartshorne1977">(Hartshorne 1977)</a>).</p>

<p>In EGA II <a class="citation" href="#EGAII">(Grothendieck 1961)</a>, Grothendieck defines quasi-finite morphisms.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Definition 5.</strong> Let \(f: X \to Y\) be a morphism of schemes.
We say that \(f\) is <strong>quasi-finite</strong> if \(f\) is of finite type and \(X_y\) is discrete for all \(y \in Y\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, \(X_y\) is discrete if and only if it is finite.
Since morphisms of finite type are stable under base change, the fiber \(X_y\) is a \(k(y)\)-scheme of finite type, and hence \(X_y\) is Noetherian (see Exer.3.13(II) of <a class="citation" href="#Hartshorne1977">(Hartshorne 1977)</a>).
It is easy to see that every discrete Noetherian topological space must be finite.
This fact explains why some books like <a class="citation" href="#Hartshorne1977">(Hartshorne 1977)</a> define quasi-finite morphisms by finite fibers instead of discrete fibers.</p>

<p>The notion of quasi-finite morphism is not purely topological due to the finite type condition. If \(K\) is a field extension of a field \(k\), the morphism \(\Spec K \to \Spec k\) is quasi-finite only when \(K\) is a finite extension of \(k\), even though both schemes involved are reduced and each consists of a single point.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Lemma 2.</strong> A finite morphism is quasi-finite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em> We reduce to the following algebraic fact: if \(\varphi : B \to A\) be a finite ring homomorphism (i.e., \(A\) is a finitely generated \(B\)-module),
then for a given prime ideal \(\qfr\) of \(B\), there are finitely many prime ideals \(\pfr\) of \(A\) such that \(\varphi^{-1}(\pfr) = \qfr\).
Note that the induced homomorphism \(\varphi_\qfr : B_\qfr \to A_\qfr\) is also finite.
Every prime ideal \(\pfr\) of \(A\) satisfying \(\varphi^{-1}(\pfr) = \qfr\) survives in \(A_\qfr\).
Let \(\nfr\coloneqq \qfr B_\qfr\) be the unique maximal ideal of \(B_\qfr\).
Since all the prime ideals of \(A_\qfr\), whose preimage is \(\nfr\), contains \(\nfr A_\qfr\), we can replace \(B_\qfr \to A_\qfr\) with \(B_\qfr / \nfr \to A_\qfr / \nfr A_\qfr\), which is still a finite ring homomorphism.
Thus, \(A_\qfr / \nfr A_\qfr\) is a finite algebra over a field, so it is Artinian and has finitely many primes (Exercises 8.2 and 8.3 of <a class="citation" href="#atiyahIntroductionCommutativeAlgebra2018a">(Atiyah and MacDonald 2018)</a>).$\quad\square$</p>

<p>The proof of Lemma 2 can be rewritten in the following proposition.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Lemma 3.</strong> Let $f: X \to Y$ be a morphism of finite type. Then $f$ is quasi-finite if and only if for every $x \in X$, the scheme $X_{f(x)}$ is a finite $k(f(x))$-scheme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The converse of Lemma 2 is false in general.
For instance, consider the embedding \(\Abb_k^1 \setminus \{0\} \hookrightarrow \Abb_k^1\) of punctured affine line into the affine line.
While it is clearly quasi-finite, it is not closed, so it is not finite by Proposition 2.
Also, there are several non-trivial examples.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1.</strong> A surjective and quasi-finite morphism need not be finite.
Let \(X_1 = X_2 = \Abb_k^1\), let \(U_1 = U_2 = \Abb_k^1 \setminus \{P\}\), where \(P\) is the point corresponding to the maximal ideal \(x\), and let \(\varphi : U_1 \to U_2\) be the identity map.
Let \(X\) be obtained by glueing \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) along \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) via \(\varphi\); i.e., \(X\) is the affine line with the point \(P\) doubled.
Let \(Y = \Spec k[x] = \Abb_k^1\), and let \(f : X \to Y\) be the morphism obtained by the identity maps \(X_1 \to Y\) and \(X_2 \to Y\).
Then this morphism is clearly surjective and has finite fibers.
It is also of finite type, since \(f^{-1}(Y)\) has two affine coverings \(\Spec k[x]\), and clearly \(k[x]\) is itself a finite\(k[x]\)-algebra.
However, \(X=f^{-1}(Y)\) is not affine, so \(f\) is not finite.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2.</strong> Let \(A\) be a Dedekind domain with field of fractions \(K\). Then \(\Spec K \to \Spec A\) is never finite, it is quasi-finite if it is of finite type, and it is of finite type if and only if \(A\) has only finitely many prime ideals.<br />
Suppose for contradiction that \(a_1/b_1, \ldots, a_n/b_n \in K\) generate \(K\) as an \(A\)-module, where \(a_i, b_i \in A\).
Since \(A\) is not a field, there exists a non-zero prime \(\pfr\), and \(A_\pfr \subseteq K\) is a discrete valuation ring with a discrete valuation \(v\).
Because \(K\) is also a field of fractions of \(A_\pfr\), and \(v\) gives the valuation on \(K\).
Thus, for any \(x \in K\), we have \(v(x) \ge - \max_i\{v(b_i)\}\).
However, clearly the valuation of \(K\) is not bounded below (e.g., for sufficiently large \(N\), the valuation of \(\pi^{-N}\) is \(-N\) where \(\pi\) is a uniformiser of \(\pfr\) in \(A_\pfr\)), a contradiction.
This shows that \(\Spec K \to \Spec A\) is never finite.
Meanwhile, it is quasi-finite by the definition if it is of finite type.
Now we show that it is of finite type if and only if \(A\) has only finitely many prime ideals.
Suppose that \(A\) has only finitely many prime ideals.
Let the non-zero prime ideals of \(A\) be \(\pfr_1, \ldots, \pfr_r\), and fix a uniformiser \(\pi_i \in \pfr_i \setminus \pfr_i^2\) for each \(i\).
Then it is easy to see that every element \(x\) in \(K\) can be expressed as
\[x = u\pi_1^{n_1} \cdots \pi_r^{n_r} \]
where \(u \in A^\times\) and \(n_i \in \mathbb{Z}\).
This shows that \(K = A[\pi_1^{-1}, \ldots, \pi_r^{-1}]\).
For the forward direction, assume \(K = A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]\) for some \(x_1, \ldots, x_n \in K\).
Write each generators in reduced from: \(x_i = a_i/b_i\) where \(a_i,b_i \in A\) and \(b_i \neq 0\).
Let \(S\) be the set of prime ideals of \(A\) dividing some \((b_i)\).
Since \(A\) is Dedekind, for each \(b_i\), only finitely many prime ideals can contain \(b_i\), so \(S\) is finite.
We claim that there is no nonzero prime of \(A\) not in \(S\).
Suppose there exists a prime \(\pfr\) not in \(S\), and let \(\pi_\pfr\) be a uniformiser of \(\pfr\).
Since \(K = A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]\), there exists some polynomial \(P(T_1, \ldots, F_n) \in A[T_1, \ldots, T_n]\) such that \(\pi_\pfr = P(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\).
Thus, we have an expression
\[ \pi_{\pfr}^{-1} = \frac{c}{b_1^{e_1} \cdots b_n^{e_n}} \quad (c \in A, \ e_i \ge 0) \]
in \(K\), so we get \(c\pi_{\pfr} = b_1^{e_1} \cdots b_n^{e_n}\), a contradiction.</p>

<p>However, if we force a quasi-finite morphism to be proper, then it must be finite.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Proposition 3.</strong> Let $f: X \to Y$ be a morphism of schemes. Then $f$ is finite if and only if $f$ is proper and quasi-finite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Proof.</em> See (8.11.1)<a class="citation" href="#EGAIV_3">(Grothendieck 1966)</a> under the assumption that the morphism is locally of finite presentation, or <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02LS">Tag 02LS</a> <a class="citation" href="#stacks-project">(The Stacks project authors 2025)</a> for any morphism (in fact, we can prove it using Zariski’s Main Theorem). $\quad\square$</p>

<p>Proposition 3 is extremely useful in practice. 
In general, showing directly that a morphism is finite is not easy.
However, for properness, we have the valuative criterion, and quasi-finiteness is not difficult to check.</p>

<p>Quasi-finite morphisms also have several good properties.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Proposition 4.</strong> 
1. Any immersion is quasi-finite.<br />
2. The composite of two quasi-finite morphisms is quasi-finite.<br />
3. Any base change of a quasi-finite morphism is quasi-finite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em> We only show (3). Let \(f: X \to S\) be quasi-finite and \(S’ \to S\) arbitrary, and assume \(s’ \mapsto s\).
Then \( \Spec k(s’) \to S’ \to S \) factors through the point \(s\), so we get
\[ 
\begin{aligned}
    \left(X \times_S S’\right)_{s’} 
    &amp;= \left(X \times_{S} S’\right) \times_{S’} k(s’) \\
    &amp;\cong X \times_S \left( S’ \times_{S’} k(s’) \right) \\
    &amp;\cong X \times_S k(s’) \\
    &amp;\cong X \times_S \left(\Spec k(s) \otimes_{k(s)} k(s’) \right) \\
    &amp;\cong \left(X \times_S \Spec k(s) \right) \otimes_{k(s)} k(s’) \\
    &amp;= X_s \otimes_{k(s)} k(s’).
\end{aligned}
\]
Since \(X_s\) is finite over \(k(s)\) by Lemma 3, and finite morphism is stable under base change, we conclude that \(X_s \otimes_{k(s)} k(s’)\) is finite over \(k(s’)\).
By Lemma 3, this shows that \( \left(X \times_S S’\right)_{s’} \) is discrete. $\quad\square$</p>

<p>In most cases, the previous definition of quasi-finite morphisms is sufficient.
Nevertheless, Grothendieck added definitions of quasi-finiteness in local sense in the 2nd edition of EGA I <a class="citation" href="#EGAI2">(Grothendieck and Dieudonné 1971)</a></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Definition 6.</strong> Let \(f: X \to Y\) be a morphism of schemes.<br />

<p><em>Proof.</em> See <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01TI">Tag 01TI</a> <a class="citation" href="#stacks-project">(The Stacks project authors 2025)</a>.$\quad\square$</p>

<p>I think he might realize that ‘quasi-finite at a point’ is a useful notion in practice when applying theorems about quasi-finite morphisms.
A good example would be an application of Zariski’s Main Theorem.</p>

<h3 id="zariskis-main-theorem"><strong>3. Zariski’s Main Theorem</strong></h3>

<p>The classical statement of Zariski’s Main Theorem in <a class="citation" href="#zariskiFoundationsGeneralTheory1943">(Zariski 1943)</a> is as follows.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Theorem 1 (Zariski’s Main Theorem–Original Version).</strong>  If \(W\) is an irreducible fundamental variety on \(V\) of a birational correspondence $T$ between $V$ and $V’$, and if $T$ has no fundamental elements on $V’$, then–under the assumption that $V$ is locally normal at $W$–each irreducible component of the transform $T[W]$ is of higher dimension than $W$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This theorem contains several terminologies not used in now days.
Very roughly, the theorem says that if the target has no ‘bad points(fundamental elements)’, then a birational maps can not contract any ‘bad parts(fundamental variety)’ in the source: every such ‘bad part’ is sent to a subvariety of strictly higher dimension.</p>

<p>Historically, there have been numerous variants of Zariski’s Main Theorem, and it can be difficult to verify how they are related to one another.
One such version appears in <a class="citation" href="#Mumford1999-RedBook">(Mumford 1999)</a>, where the author provides an intuitive explanation of Zariski’s Main Theorem for varieties over $\mathbb{C}$ and explains how several versions of Zariski’s Matin Theorem are realted.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Theorem 2 (Zariski’s Main Theorem–The Red Book Version).</strong>  Let $X$ be a normal variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ and let $f : X’ \to X$ be a birational morphism with finite fibres from a variety $X’$ to $X$.
Then $f$ is an isomorphism of $X’$ with an open subset $U \subseteq X$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In EGA III, Grothendieck states The Red Book Version in the language of scheme theory.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Theorem 3 (Zariski’s Main Theorem–Grothendieck’s 1st Version).</strong>
Let $Y$ be a Noetherian scheme and let $f : X \to Y$ be a quasi-projective morphism.
Denote by $X’$ the set of points $x \in X$ that are isolated in their fiber, i.e., such that $x$ is an isolated point of the fiber $f^{-1}(f(x))$. Then $X’$ is an open subset of $X$, and the induced subscheme $X’$ is isomorphic to the subscheme induced on an open subset of a $Y$-scheme $Y’$ that is finite over $Y$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Proof.</em> (4.4.3)<a class="citation" href="#EGAIII_1">(Grothendieck 1961)</a>$\quad\square$</p>

<p>Grothendieck eventually realized that the first version suggests a deeper structural property of quasi-finite morphisms, and subsequently stated a more general version in EGA IV.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote border-start ps-3">
  <p><strong>Theorem 4 (Zariski’s Main Theorem–Grothendieck’s 2nd Version).</strong>
Let $Y$ be a quasi-compact and quasi-separated scheme.
If $f : X \to Y$ is quasi-finite, separated, and of finite presentation, then $f$ factors as $X \xrightarrow{f’} Y’ \xrightarrow{u} Y $, where $f’$ is an open immersion and $u$ is a finite morphism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Proof.</em> The proof demands a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics. See 8.12 of <a class="citation" href="#EGAIV_3">(Grothendieck 1966)</a> or <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02LQ">Tag 02LQ</a><a class="citation" href="#stacks-project">(The Stacks project authors 2025)</a>.$\quad\square$</p>

<p>The theorem says that quasi-finite morphisms are essentially “almost finite” morphisms. Since quasi-finite morphisms arise naturally in several circumstances, Zariski’s Main Theorem enables us to apply powerful theories (e.g., étale cohomology theory).
We close this post with two toy applications of Zariski’s Main Theorem.
The first example is a proof of Proposition 3.</p>

<p><strong>Proof of Proposition 3.</strong> Note that finiteness is a local property, so we may assume \(X\) is affine, which is quasi-compact.
Let \(f = u \circ f’\) be the factorization as in Zariski’s Main Theorem.
Since the composite of two finite morphisms is finite, it suffices to show that \(f’\) is finite.
Consider the graph morphism \(\Gamma_{f’}: X \to X \times_X Y’\) defined by \(x \mapsto (x,f’(x))\).
It is known that any graph of a separated morphism is a closed immersion (<a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/024T">Tag 024T</a><a class="citation" href="#stacks-project">(The Stacks project authors 2025)</a> or (5.2.4)<a class="citation" href="#EGAI2">(Grothendieck and Dieudonné 1971)</a>, so \(\Gamma_{f’}\) is a closed immersion (hence finite and proper).
Thus, \(f’\) is proper, since \(f’ = p_{Y’} \circ \Gamma_f\) with the projection \( p_{Y’} : X \times_X Y’ \to Y’ \).
This shows that \(f’\) is an immersion with a closed image, that is, a closed immersion (<a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01IQ">Tag 01IQ</a><a class="citation" href="#stacks-project">(The Stacks project authors 2025)</a>).
This ends the proof.$\quad\square$</p>

<p>Throughout this discussion, every ring has a multiplicative identity $1$, and every ring homomorphism $\varphi: A \to B$ must satisfy $\varphi(1_A) = 1_B$.
The ring of integers is denoted by $\mathbb{Z}$.</p>

<p>Several sources define the characteristic of a ring as follows.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> The <em>characteristic</em> of a ring $A$, denoted by $\operatorname{char}(A)$, is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 = 0$ ($n$ times) in $A$; if no such integer exists the characteristic of $A$ is said to be $0$.</p>

<p>A merit of this definition is that it is simple and purely elementary. 
However, it is not surprising that many students who first encounter this definition feel confused by ‘the characteristic $0$’.
Many students think characteristic $\infty$ is more natural than $0$ according to the above definition.
The following is the elementary proof showing that the characteristic of a field must be a prime in [1].</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 1.</strong> The characteristic of a field $F$, $\operatorname{char}(F)$, is either $0$ or a prime $p$.
Furthermore, if $n \cdot 1_F = 0$ for $n &gt; 0$, then $n$ is divisible by $p$.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>. For a positive integer $n$, let $n \cdot 1_F \coloneqq 1_F + \cdots + 1_F$ ($n$ times).
It is easy to see that</p>

\[(n \cdot 1_F)(m \cdot 1_F) = mn \cdot 1_F\]

<p>for positive integers $m$ and $n$.
If $n = ab$ is composite with $n \cdot 1_F = 0$, then $ab \cdot 1_F = (a \cdot 1_F)(b \cdot 1_F) = 0$, and since $F$ is a field, one of $a \cdot 1_F$ or $b \cdot 1_F$ is $0$.
Hence, the smallest such integer is necessarily a prime.
It also follows that if $n \cdot 1_F = 0$ for $n &gt; 0$, then $n$ is divisible by $p$.$\qquad\square$</p>

<p>However, as one studies (commutative) algebra more deeply, one comes to realize that another equivalent characterization of the characteristic of a ring is conceptually more useful.
It is straightforward to check that the following fact holds, using the assumption that every ring homomorphism preserves the multiplicative identities.</p>

<p><strong>Fact.</strong> For a ring $A$, there exists a unique ring homomorphism $\mathbb{Z} \to A$.</p>

<p><strong>Remark.</strong> The fact says that $\mathbb{Z}$ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_and_terminal_objects">initial object</a> of the category of rings.</p>

<p>One can easily check the following definition is equivalent to the original usual definition of the characteristic of a ring.</p>

<p><strong>(New) Definition.</strong> The <em>characteristic</em> of a ring $A$, denoted by $\operatorname{char}(A)$, is the non-negative generator of the unique ring homomorphism $\mathbb{Z} \to A$.</p>

<p>In this sense, the concept of ‘characteristic $0$’ becomes very natural.
If there is no positive integer $n$ such that $1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 = 0$ ($n$ times) in $A$, then the unique homomorphism $\mathbb{Z} \to A$ must be injective, implying that the kernel is $0$.
This definition is not only conceptually useful, but also practical in actual problem solving.
The following is a new proof of Proposition 1.</p>

<p><em>New proof of Proposition 1.</em> Consider the unique ring homomorphism $\mathbb{Z} \to F$.
Since any subring of $F$ is an integral domain, the kernel of the map must be prime, so the characteristic is $0$ or a prime $p$.
If $n \cdot 1_F = 0$ for $n &gt; 0$, then the ideal $(n)$ must be contained in $(p)$, implying that $p \mid n$.$\qquad\square$</p>

<p>As you can see, the proof becomes more systematic and is beautifully described in the language of ideal theory.
This approach can be applied to other problems.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1.</strong> Suppose $((A_i)_{i \in I}, (f_{ij})_{i \le j \in I})$ is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_limit">inverse system</a> of commutative rings.
Suppose for each $i \in I$, the ring $A_i$ has a positive characteristic.
Then what can we say about the characteristic of its inverse limit?</p>

<p><em>Solution.</em> Consider the unique ring homomorphism $\varphi_i : \mathbb{Z} \to A_i$.
Then the characteristic $n_i$ of $A_i$ is precisely the kernel $n_i\mathbb{Z}$ of $\varphi_i$.
Hence, we get an exact sequence of $\mathbb{Z}$-modules</p>

\[0 \to n_i\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \to A_i.\]

<p>Since the inverse limit is left exact (see Proposition 10.2 of [2]), we get</p>

\[0 \to \varprojlim_I n_i\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \to \varprojlim_I A_i.\]

<p>Thus, the characteristic of $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longleftarrow}} A_i$ is the non-negative generator of $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longleftarrow}} n_i\mathbb{Z}$.
Note that $n_j\mathbb{Z} \le n_i\mathbb{Z}$ whenever $i \le j$; i.e., $n_i$ must divide $n_j$.
Thus, if $n_i$ is unbounded, then $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longleftarrow}} n_i\mathbb{Z} = 0$.
Otherwise, $n_i$ is eventually stabilized to their least common multiple $L$, and it is precisely the characteristic of $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longleftarrow}} A_i$. $\quad\square$</p>

<p><strong>Remark.</strong> It might sound surprising that the inverse limit of rings of positive characteristic can have characteristic $0$.
However, there is a well-known example.
For a fixed prime $p$, consider the inverse system $\mathbb{Z}/p^i\mathbb{Z}$ for $i \ge 1$, where $\mathbb{Z}/p^j\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/p^i\mathbb{Z}$ is the natural quotient by $(p^{j-i})\left(\mathbb{Z}/p^j\mathbb{Z}\right)$ for $j &gt; i$. The inverse limit is the ring of $p$-adic integer $\mathbb{Z}_p$, which is known to have characteristic $0$.</p>

<p>We can use the same strategy for the dual problem.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 2.</strong> Suppose $((B_i)_{i \in I}, (g_{ij})_{i \le j \in I})$ is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_limit">direct system</a> of commutative rings.
Suppose for each $i \in I$, the ring $B_i$ has a positive characteristic.
Then what can we say about the characteristic of its direct limit?</p>

<p><em>Solution.</em> Consider the unique ring homomorphism $\varphi_i : \mathbb{Z} \to B_i$.
Then the characteristic $m_i$ of $B_i$ is precisely the kernel $m_i\mathbb{Z}$ of $\varphi_i$.
Hence, we get an exact sequence of $\mathbb{Z}$-modules</p>

\[0 \to m_i\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \to B_i.\]

<p>Since the direct limit is exact (see Exercise 2.19 of [2]), we get</p>

\[0 \to \varinjlim_I m_i\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \to \varinjlim_I A_i.\]

<p>Thus, the characteristic of $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longrightarrow}} B_i$ is the non-negative generator of $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longrightarrow}} m_i\mathbb{Z}$.
Note that $m_j\mathbb{Z} \ge m_i\mathbb{Z}$ whenever $i \le j$; i.e., $m_j$ must divide $m_i$.
Thus, $m_i$ must be eventually stabilized to their greatest common divisor $D$, and it is precisely the characteristic of $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longrightarrow}} B_i$. $\quad\square$</p>

To do so, let’s briefly review what the $p$-adic numbers are.</p>

<h3 id="p-adic-numbers"><strong>1. $p$-adic Numbers</strong></h3>

<p>Throughout this post, $p$ is a fixed positive prime number. The <strong>$p$-adic valuation</strong> of an integer $n$ is defined to be</p>

\[\nu_p(n) \coloneqq \begin{cases}
   \max\left\{ k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} : p^k \mid n \right\} &amp;\text{if } n \neq 0, \\
   \infty &amp;\text{if } n = 0,
\end{cases}\]

<p>where $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ denotes the set of non-negative integers.
For a rational number $r/s$ with $r \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $s \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$, we define</p>

\[\nu_p\left( \frac{r}{s} \right) \coloneqq \nu_p(r) - \nu_p(s).\]

<p>Then, the function $\nu_p : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Z} \cup \{\infty\}$ satisfies</p>

<ol>
  <li>$\nu_p(xy) = \nu_p(x) + \nu_p(y)$</li>
  <li>$\nu_p(x+y) \ge \min\{ \nu_p(x), \nu_p(y) \}$ (equality holds when $\nu_p(x) \neq \nu_p(y)$)</li>
  <li>$\nu(x) = \infty \iff x = 0$</li>
</ol>

<p>(i.e., $\nu_p$ is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_valuation">discrete valuation</a> on $\mathbb{Q}$). 
The <strong>$p$-adic absolute value</strong> on $\mathbb{Q}$ is the function $|\cdot|_p : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ defined by</p>

\[|x|_p \coloneqq p^{-\nu_p(x)}.\]

<p>It is an easy exercise to show that $|\cdot|_p$ satisfies non-negativity, positive-definiteness, multiplicativity, and the triangle inequality. 
In fact, it satisfies an inequality stronger than the triangle inequality, called <strong>strong traingle inequality</strong> or <strong>ultrametric inequality</strong></p>

\[|x+y|_p \le \max \left\{ |x|_p, |y|_p\right\},\]

<p>where the equality holds when $|x|_p \neq |y|_p$ Thus, this absolute value induces a metric $d : \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ defined by $d(x,y)\coloneqq |x-y|_p$.
The completetion with respet to this metric to the $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{Q}_p$, the $p$-adic numbers.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="theory-of-non-archimedean-fields"><strong>2. Theory of Non-Archimedean Fields.</strong></h3>

<p>In this section, we introduce non-Arhimdean fields, which are generalizations of $p$-adic numbers, and review their important properties.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Let $K$ be a field. A map $|\cdot|: K \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ is called a <strong>non-Archimedean absolute value</strong> if for all $x,y \in K$ the following hold:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$,</li>
  <li>$|xy| = |x||y|$,</li>
  <li>$|x+y| \le \max\{|x|, |y|\}$</li>
</ol>

<p>A fiedl with a non-Archimdean absolute value is called a <strong>non-Archimedean field</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Lemma 1.</strong> Let $K$ be a field with a non-Archimedean absolute value $|\cdot|$. For $x,y \in K$ with $|x| \neq |y|$, we have $|x+y| = \max\{ |x|, |y| \}$.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> Without loss of generality, assume $|x| &lt; |y|$.
Then we get $|x+y| \le \max\{|x|, |y|\} = |y|$.
On the other hand, we have</p>

\[|y| = |(x+y)-x| \le \max\{ |x+y|, |x| \},\]

<p>so $|y| \le |x+y|$ by the assumption that $|x| &lt; |y|$. This completes the proof. $\quad\square$</p>

<p>Let $K$ be a field with a non-Archimedean absolute value $|\cdot|$.
As usual, the absolute value gives a metric $d(x,y) \coloneqq |x-y|$.
A non-Archimedan field $K$ is called <strong>complete</strong> if every Cauchy sequence converges in $k$.
For instance, the $p$-adic number $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a typical example of complete non-Archimedean fields.
Complete non-Archimedean field has several useful algebraic properties.</p>

<p><strong>Theroem 1.</strong> Let $K$ be a complete with respect to the given non-archimedean absolute value $|\cdot|$, and let $L$ be an algebraic extension of $K$.
Then there exists a unique non-Archimedean absolute value on $L$ extending the absolute value $|\cdot|$ from $K$.
Furthermore, $L$ is complete if $[L : K] &lt; \infty$.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> See Theorem 2 of (3.2.4) of [1].$\quad\square$</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 1.</strong> Let $K$ be complete with respect to the given non-Archimedean absolute value $|\cdot|$, and let $L$ be a finite extension of $K$.
For $y \in L$, let $X^m + a_{m-1}X^{m-1} + \cdots a_0 \in K[X]$ be the minimal monic polynomial of $y$ over $K$. Then</p>

\[|y| = |a_m|^{1/m} = \left| N_{L/K}(y) \right|^{1/[L:K]},\]

<p>where $N_{L/K}: L \to K$ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_norm">field norm</a>.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> See Proposition 3 of (3.2.4) of [1].$\quad\square$</p>

<p>For a field $K$ provided with a non-archimedean absolute value $|\cdot|$, we denote its algebraic closure by $\overline{K}$, and we denote its completion by $\hat{K}$.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 2.</strong> Let $K$ be a non-Archimedean field. If $K$ is algebraically closed, then completion $\widehat{K}$ of $K$ is algebraically closed.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> See Proposition 3 of (3.4.1) of [1].$\quad\square$</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="algebraically-closed-complete-field-mathbbcp"><strong>3. Algebraically Closed Complete Field $\mathbb{C}_p$</strong></h3>

<p>We denote the completion of the algebraically closure of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ by $\mathbb{C}_p$.
Then by the Proposition 2, the field $\mathbb{C}_p$ has a unique extension of $|\cdot|_p$, and it is still algebraically closed.
For a non-Archimedean field $K$ with an absolute value $|\cdot| : K \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, we denote the image of the function $|\cdot|$ by $|K|$, which is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. In this section, we calculate what $|\mathbb{C}_p|$ exactly is.
To do so, we need an (almost trivial) claim, which is a result of ultrametric inequality.</p>

<p><strong>Claim.</strong> Let $K$ be a field with a non-Archimedean absolute value $|\cdot|$. Then $|K| = \left|\widehat{K} \right|$.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> Let $x$ be a nonzero element of $\widehat{K}$.
Then there exists a Cauchy sequence $\{x_i\}_i$ in $K$ such that $x_i \to x$.
We may assume that $x_i \neq 0$ for all $i$.
Since $\{x_i\}_i$ is Cauchy, and since $\{|x_i|\}$ must be bounded below, there exists some sufficiently large positive integer $N$ such that for all $m \ge n \ge N$</p>

\[|x_n - x_m| &lt; |x_n|.\]

<p>Then the ultrametric triangular inequality tells us that</p>

\[|x_m| = |x_n + (x_m - x_n)| = \max\{ |x_n|, |x_m - x_n| \} = |x_n|.\]

<p>This shows that $|x| = |x_N| \in |K|$. $\quad\square$</p>

<p>By the definition, we have $|\mathbb{Q}_p| = p^{\mathbb{Z}} \cup \{0\}$ where $p^{\mathbb{Z}} \coloneqq \{ p^n : n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$.
Combining this fact with Propositoin 1, we obtain $|\overline{\mathbb{Q}_p}| = p^{\mathbb{Q}}$ where $p^{\mathbb{Q}} \coloneqq \{ p^r : r \in \mathbb{Q} \}$.
However, the Claim shows that $|\mathbb{C}_p| = p^{\mathbb{Q}} \cup {0}$, and it is easy to observe the it is a non-complete subset of $\mathbb{R}$.</p>

<p>I believe that these peculiar topological behaviors of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $\mathbb{C}_p$ are related to their total disconnectedness.
However, their less intuitive topological behaviors make room for rich algebraic techniques used for studying them.</p>

I wrote this simple post to review some linear algebra and test <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>.</p>

<p>Given finite dimensional vector spaces $U$ and $V$ over the same field $k$, let $\text{Hom}_k \,(U,V)$ denote the set of $k$-linear map (i.e. linear transformation) from $U$ to $V$. It is easy to see that $\text{Hom}_k \,(U,V)$ is itself a $k$-vector space. One might learn fun fact that we can identify $\text{Hom}_k \,(U,V)$ with the tensor product $U^\ast \otimes V$, where $U^\ast$ is the dual space of $U$ (i.e., $U^\ast = \text{Hom}_k \,(U,k)$). Precisely, there is a <strong>natural</strong> isomorphism $\phi : U^\ast \otimes V \rightarrow \text{Hom}_k \,(U,V)$ given by</p>

\[f \otimes v \longmapsto (u \mapsto f(u)v),\]

<p>for $v \in V$, $u \in U$, and $f \in U^\ast$. It is obvious that $\phi$ is a $k$-linear map. To show it is actually an isomorphism of $k$-vector spaces, we find its two-sided inverse. Let $\lbrace u_i \rbrace_{i \in I}$ be a basis for $U$ and $\lbrace u_i^\ast\rbrace_{i\in I}$ be the corresponding dual basis for $U^\ast$; that is, $u_i^\ast(u_j) \coloneqq \delta_{ij}$ where $\delta_{ij}$ is Kronecker’s delta.</p>

<p>Then we define a $k$-linear map $\psi : \text{Hom}_k \,(U,V) \rightarrow U^\ast \otimes V$ as</p>

\[g \longmapsto \sum_{i \in I}u_i^\ast \otimes g(u_i),\]

<p>for $g \in \text{Hom}_k \,(U,V)$. It is easy to check $\psi$ is actually a $k$-linear map and the two-sided inverse of $\phi$. One may feel awkward since our construction of $\psi$ seems to highly depend on the choice of $\left\{ u_i \right\}_{i \in I}$. However, surprisingly, $\psi$ is also canonical since its inverse does not depend on the choice of basis. This shows it is <strong>possible</strong> that <strong>a $k$-linear map essentially does not depend on the choice of basis, though its construction or expression involves specific elements of some basis</strong>. Otherwise, one may show expliclity that for another basis $\{t_i\}_{i \in I}$ for $U$ and the correponding dual basis $\{t_i^\ast\}_{i \in I}$, new $k$-linear map $\psi’ : \text{Hom}_k \,(U,V) \rightarrow U^\ast \otimes V$ defined using $\{t_i^\ast\}_{i \in I}$ coincide with $\psi$. It is quite hard (impossible for me) to imagine constructing a two-sided inverse of $\phi$ without dual bases. However, it does not imply $\phi$ is non-canonical.</p>

<p>Let’s move on to another example. Let $V$ be a vector space over $k$, and $V^{\otimes n} \coloneqq \underbrace{V \otimes \cdots \otimes V}_{n\text{-times}}$ and $V^{\otimes 0} \coloneqq k$. If $I = (i_1, \ldots, i_n)$ and $J = (j_1, \ldots, j_n)$ are two sequences of $n$ distinct indices from $\{1, \ldots, p\}$ and $\{1, \ldots, q\}$, respectively, we define a contraction map</p>

\[c^I_J : V^{\otimes p} \otimes (V^\ast)^{\otimes q} \longrightarrow V^{\otimes (p-n)} \otimes (V^\ast)^{\otimes (q-n)}\]

<p>which sends $v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_p \otimes f_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes f_q$ to</p>

\[\left( \prod_{\alpha=1}^n f_{j_\alpha}(v_{i_\alpha}) \right)
v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \overgroup{v_{i_1}\otimes \cdots \otimes v_{i_n}} \otimes \cdots \otimes v_p \otimes 
f_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \overgroup{f_{j_1}\otimes \cdots \otimes f_{j_n}} \otimes \cdots \otimes f_q\]

<p>where $\overgroup{\hspace{10pt}}$ means omitting the terms below. If $p=q=n$ and $I=J=(1, \ldots, n)$, then the contraction becomes a map $c : V^{\otimes n} \otimes (V^\ast)^{\otimes n} \to k$ given by</p>

\[v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_n \otimes f_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes f_n \longmapsto \prod_{\alpha =1}^n f_\alpha(v_\alpha).\]

<p>Then $c$ induces a $k$-linear map $c_\star : (V^\ast)^{\otimes n} \to (V^{\otimes n})^\ast$ defined as</p>

\[f_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes f_n \longmapsto (v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_n \mapsto c(v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_n \otimes f_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes f_n)).\]

<p>The construction of $c$ and $c_\star$ are natural. We claim that $c_\star$ is actually an isomorphism; that is, we can identify $(V^\ast)^{\otimes n}$ with $(V^{\otimes n})^\ast$ (which sounds intuitive!). Let $\{e_1, \ldots, e_m\}$ be a basis for $V$, and $\{e_1^\ast, \ldots, e_m^\ast\}$ be the corresponding dual basis for $V^\ast$. Then $\{e_{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{i_n} \}_{\underline{i} \in I^n}$ forms a basis for $V^{\otimes n}$, where $I = \{1, \ldots, m\}$ and $\underline{i} \coloneqq (i_1, \ldots, i_n) \in I^n$. We also have the correponding dual basis $\{\left(e_{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{i_n}\right)^\ast \}_{\underline{i} \in I^n}$ for $(V^{\otimes n})^\ast$. Define a $k$-linear map $d_\star : (V^{\otimes n})^\ast \to (V^\ast)^{\otimes n}$ by</p>

\[F = \sum_{\underline{i} \in I^n}\lambda_{\underline{i}}\left(e_{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{i_n}\right)^\ast \longmapsto \sum_{\underline{i} \in I^n}\lambda_{\underline{i}}e_{i_1}^\ast \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{i_n}^\ast.\]

<p>By tedious computations, one can show $d_\star$ is actually the two-sided inverse of $c_\star$. Similar to the previous example, the construction of $d_\star$ looks dependent on the choice of ${e_1, \ldots, e_n}$, but it does not in fact. Therefore, we can <strong>naturally identify</strong> $(V^{\otimes n})^\ast$ with $(V^\ast)^{\otimes n}$, though the expression of $d_\star$ involves ${e_1, \ldots, e_n}$. (Can you show that this identification may fail if $V$ is not finite-dimensional?)</p>

<p>In linear algebra, there are lots of objects with basis-free definition looking dependent to the choice of basis. Important examples taught in typical undergraduate linear algebra courses are determinant and trace. We define the determinant and trace of linear transformation $T$ using their matrix representation (i.e., using bases), but the values do not be affected by the choice of basis. Under the same philosophy, it is important to notice that a non-canonical-looking expression does not imply it is non-canonical.</p>
