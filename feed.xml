<p>Throughout this discussion, every ring has a multiplicative identity $1$, and every ring homomorphism $\varphi: A \to B$ must satisfy $\varphi(1_A) = 1_B$.
The ring of integers is denoted by $\mathbb{Z}$.</p>

<p>Several sources define the characteristic of a ring as follows.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> The <em>characteristic</em> of a ring $A$, denoted by $\operatorname{char}(A)$, is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 = 0$ ($n$ times) in $A$; if no such integer exists the characteristic of $A$ is said to be $0$.</p>

<p>A merit of this definition is that it is simple and purely elementary. 
However, it is not surprising that many students who first encounter this definition feel confused by ‘the characteristic $0$’.
Many students think characteristic $\infty$ is more natural than $0$ according to the above definition.
The following is the elementary proof showing that the characteristic of a field must be a prime in [1].</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 1.</strong> The characteristic of a field $F$, $\operatorname{char}(F)$, is either $0$ or a prime $p$.
Furthermore, if $n \cdot 1_F = 0$ for $n &gt; 0$, then $n$ is divisible by $p$.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>. For a positive integer $n$, let $n \cdot 1_F \coloneqq 1_F + \cdots + 1_F$ ($n$ times).
It is easy to see that</p>

\[(n \cdot 1_F)(m \cdot 1_F) = mn \cdot 1_F\]

<p>for positive integers $m$ and $n$.
If $n = ab$ is composite with $n \cdot 1_F = 0$, then $ab \cdot 1_F = (a \cdot 1_F)(b \cdot 1_F) = 0$, and since $F$ is a field, one of $a \cdot 1_F$ or $b \cdot 1_F$ is $0$.
Hence, the smallest such integer is necessarily a prime.
It also follows that if $n \cdot 1_F = 0$ for $n &gt; 0$, then $n$ is divisible by $p$.$\qquad\square$</p>

<p>However, as one studies (commutative) algebra more deeply, one comes to realize that another equivalent characterization of the characteristic of a ring is conceptually more useful.
It is straightforward to check that the following fact holds, using the assumption that every ring homomorphism preserves the multiplicative identities.</p>

<p><strong>Fact.</strong> For a ring $A$, there exists a unique ring homomorphism $\mathbb{Z} \to A$.</p>

<p><strong>Remark.</strong> The fact says that $\mathbb{Z}$ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_and_terminal_objects">initial object</a> of the category of rings.</p>

<p>One can easily check the following definition is equivalent to the original usual definition of the characteristic of a ring.</p>

<p><strong>(New) Definition.</strong> The <em>characteristic</em> of a ring $A$, denoted by $\operatorname{char}(A)$, is the non-negative generator of the unique ring homomorphism $\mathbb{Z} \to A$.</p>

<p>In this sense, the concept of ‘characteristic $0$’ becomes very natural.
If there is no positive integer $n$ such that $1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 = 0$ ($n$ times) in $A$, then the unique homomorphism $\mathbb{Z} \to A$ must be injective, implying that the kernel is $0$.
This definition is not only conceptually useful, but also practical in actual problem solving.
The following is a new proof of Proposition 1.</p>

<p><em>New proof of Proposition 1.</em> Consider the unique ring homomorphism $\mathbb{Z} \to F$.
Since any subring of $F$ is an integral domain, the kernel of the map must be prime, so the characteristic is $0$ or a prime $p$.
If $n \cdot 1_F = 0$ for $n &gt; 0$, then the ideal $(n)$ must be contained in $(p)$, implying that $p \mid n$.$\qquad\square$</p>

<p>As you can see, the proof becomes more systematic and is beautifully described in the language of ideal theory.
This approach can be applied to other problems.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1.</strong> Suppose $((A_i)_{i \in I}, (f_{ij})_{i \le j \in I})$ is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_limit">inverse system</a> of commutative rings.
Suppose for each $i \in I$, the ring $A_i$ has a positive characteristic.
Then what can we say about the characteristic of its inverse limit?</p>

<p><em>Solution.</em> Consider the unique ring homomorphism $\varphi_i : \mathbb{Z} \to A_i$.
Then the characteristic $n_i$ of $A_i$ is precisely the kernel $n_i\mathbb{Z}$ of $\varphi_i$.
Hence, we get an exact sequence of $\mathbb{Z}$-modules</p>

\[0 \to n_i\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \to A_i.\]

<p>Since the inverse limit is left exact (see Proposition 10.2 of [2]), we get</p>

\[0 \to \varprojlim_I n_i\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \to \varprojlim_I A_i.\]

<p>Thus, the characteristic of $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longleftarrow}} A_i$ is the non-negative generator of $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longleftarrow}} n_i\mathbb{Z}$.
Note that $n_j\mathbb{Z} \le n_i\mathbb{Z}$ whenever $i \le j$; i.e., $n_i$ must divide $n_j$.
Thus, if $n_i$ is unbounded, then $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longleftarrow}} n_i\mathbb{Z} = 0$.
Otherwise, $n_i$ is eventually stabilized to their least common multiple $L$, and it is precisely the characteristic of $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longleftarrow}} A_i$. $\quad\square$</p>

<p><strong>Remark.</strong> It might sound surprising that the inverse limit of rings of positive characteristic can have characteristic $0$.
However, there is a well-known example.
For a fixed prime $p$, consider the inverse system $\mathbb{Z}/p^i\mathbb{Z}$ for $i \ge 1$, where $\mathbb{Z}/p^j\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/p^i\mathbb{Z}$ is the natural quotient by $(p^{j-i})\left(\mathbb{Z}/p^j\mathbb{Z}\right)$ for $j &gt; i$. The inverse limit is the ring of $p$-adic integer $\mathbb{Z}_p$, which is known to have characteristic $0$.</p>

<p>We can use the same strategy for the dual problem.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 2.</strong> Suppose $((B_i)_{i \in I}, (g_{ij})_{i \le j \in I})$ is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_limit">direct system</a> of commutative rings.
Suppose for each $i \in I$, the ring $B_i$ has a positive characteristic.
Then what can we say about the characteristic of its direct limit?</p>

<p><em>Solution.</em> Consider the unique ring homomorphism $\varphi_i : \mathbb{Z} \to B_i$.
Then the characteristic $m_i$ of $B_i$ is precisely the kernel $m_i\mathbb{Z}$ of $\varphi_i$.
Hence, we get an exact sequence of $\mathbb{Z}$-modules</p>

\[0 \to m_i\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \to B_i.\]

<p>Since the direct limit is exact (see Exercise 2.19 of [2]), we get</p>

\[0 \to \varinjlim_I m_i\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \to \varinjlim_I A_i.\]

<p>Thus, the characteristic of $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longrightarrow}} B_i$ is the non-negative generator of $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longrightarrow}} m_i\mathbb{Z}$.
Note that $m_j\mathbb{Z} \ge m_i\mathbb{Z}$ whenever $i \le j$; i.e., $m_j$ must divide $m_i$.
Thus, $m_i$ must be eventually stabilized to their greatest common divisor $D$, and it is precisely the characteristic of $\displaystyle\lim_{\underset{I}{\longrightarrow}} B_i$. $\quad\square$</p>

To do so, let’s briefly review what the $p$-adic numbers are.</p>

<h3 id="p-adic-numbers"><strong>1. $p$-adic Numbers</strong></h3>

<p>Throughout this post, $p$ is a fixed positive prime number. The <strong>$p$-adic valuation</strong> of an integer $n$ is defined to be</p>

\[\nu_p(n) \coloneqq \begin{cases}
   \max\left\{ k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} : p^k \mid n \right\} &amp;\text{if } n \neq 0, \\
   \infty &amp;\text{if } n = 0,
\end{cases}\]

<p>where $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ denotes the set of non-negative integers.
For a rational number $r/s$ with $r \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $s \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$, we define</p>

\[\nu_p\left( \frac{r}{s} \right) \coloneqq \nu_p(r) - \nu_p(s).\]

<p>Then, the function $\nu_p : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Z} \cup \{\infty\}$ satisfies</p>

<ol>
  <li>$\nu_p(xy) = \nu_p(x) + \nu_p(y)$</li>
  <li>$\nu_p(x+y) \ge \min\{ \nu_p(x), \nu_p(y) \}$ (equality holds when $\nu_p(x) \neq \nu_p(y)$)</li>
  <li>$\nu(x) = \infty \iff x = 0$</li>
</ol>

<p>(i.e., $\nu_p$ is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_valuation">discrete valuation</a> on $\mathbb{Q}$). 
The <strong>$p$-adic absolute value</strong> on $\mathbb{Q}$ is the function $|\cdot|_p : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ defined by</p>

\[|x|_p \coloneqq p^{-\nu_p(x)}.\]

<p>It is an easy exercise to show that $|\cdot|_p$ satisfies non-negativity, positive-definiteness, multiplicativity, and the triangle inequality. 
In fact, it satisfies an inequality stronger than the triangle inequality, called <strong>strong traingle inequality</strong> or <strong>ultrametric inequality</strong></p>

\[|x+y|_p \le \max \left\{ |x|_p, |y|_p\right\},\]

<p>where the equality holds when $|x|_p \neq |y|_p$ Thus, this absolute value induces a metric $d : \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ defined by $d(x,y)\coloneqq |x-y|_p$.
The completetion with respet to this metric to the $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{Q}_p$, the $p$-adic numbers.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="theory-of-non-archimedean-fields"><strong>2. Theory of Non-Archimedean Fields.</strong></h3>

<p>In this section, we introduce non-Arhimdean fields, which are generalizations of $p$-adic numbers, and review their important properties.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Let $K$ be a field. A map $|\cdot|: K \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ is called a <strong>non-Archimedean absolute value</strong> if for all $x,y \in K$ the following hold:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$|x| = 0 \iff x = 0$,</li>
  <li>$|xy| = |x||y|$,</li>
  <li>$|x+y| \le \max\{|x|, |y|\}$</li>
</ol>

<p>A fiedl with a non-Archimdean absolute value is called a <strong>non-Archimedean field</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Lemma 1.</strong> Let $K$ be a field with a non-Archimedean absolute value $|\cdot|$. For $x,y \in K$ with $|x| \neq |y|$, we have $|x+y| = \max\{ |x|, |y| \}$.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> Without loss of generality, assume $|x| &lt; |y|$.
Then we get $|x+y| \le \max\{|x|, |y|\} = |y|$.
On the other hand, we have</p>

\[|y| = |(x+y)-x| \le \max\{ |x+y|, |x| \},\]

<p>so $|y| \le |x+y|$ by the assumption that $|x| &lt; |y|$. This completes the proof. $\quad\square$</p>

<p>Let $K$ be a field with a non-Archimedean absolute value $|\cdot|$.
As usual, the absolute value gives a metric $d(x,y) \coloneqq |x-y|$.
A non-Archimedan field $K$ is called <strong>complete</strong> if every Cauchy sequence converges in $k$.
For instance, the $p$-adic number $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a typical example of complete non-Archimedean fields.
Complete non-Archimedean field has several useful algebraic properties.</p>

<p><strong>Theroem 1.</strong> Let $K$ be a complete with respect to the given non-archimedean absolute value $|\cdot|$, and let $L$ be an algebraic extension of $K$.
Then there exists a unique non-Archimedean absolute value on $L$ extending the absolute value $|\cdot|$ from $K$.
Furthermore, $L$ is complete if $[L : K] &lt; \infty$.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> See Theorem 2 of (3.2.4) of [1].$\quad\square$</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 1.</strong> Let $K$ be complete with respect to the given non-Archimedean absolute value $|\cdot|$, and let $L$ be a finite extension of $K$.
For $y \in L$, let $X^m + a_{m-1}X^{m-1} + \cdots a_0 \in K[X]$ be the minimal monic polynomial of $y$ over $K$. Then</p>

\[|y| = |a_m|^{1/m} = \left| N_{L/K}(y) \right|^{1/[L:K]},\]

<p>where $N_{L/K}: L \to K$ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_norm">field norm</a>.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> See Proposition 3 of (3.2.4) of [1].$\quad\square$</p>

<p>For a field $K$ provided with a non-archimedean absolute value $|\cdot|$, we denote its algebraic closure by $\overline{K}$, and we denote its completion by $\overhat{K}$.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 2.</strong> Let $K$ be a non-Archimedean field. If $K$ is algebraically closed, then completion $\widehat{K}$ of $K$ is algebraically closed.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> See Proposition 3 of (3.4.1) of [1].$\quad\square$</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="algebraically-closed-complete-field-mathbbcp"><strong>3. Algebraically Closed Complete Field $\mathbb{C}_p$</strong></h3>

<p>We denote the completion of the algebraically closure of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ by $\mathbb{C}_p$.
Then by the Proposition 2, the field $\mathbb{C}_p$ has a unique extension of $|\cdot|_p$, and it is still algebraically closed.
For a non-Archimedean field $K$ with an absolute value $|\cdot| : K \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, we denote the image of the function $|\cdot|$ by $|K|$, which is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. In this section, we calculate what $|\mathbb{C}_p|$ exactly is.
To do so, we need an (almost trivial) claim, which is a result of ultrametric inequality.</p>

<p><strong>Claim.</strong> Let $K$ be a field with a non-Archimedean absolute value $|\cdot|$. Then $|K| = \left|\widehat{K} \right|$.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> Let $x$ be a nonzero element of $\widehat{K}$.
Then there exists a Cauchy sequence $\{x_i\}_i$ in $K$ such that $x_i \to x$.
We may assume that $x_i \neq 0$ for all $i$.
Since $\{x_i\}_i$ is Cauchy, and since $\{|x_i|\}$ must be bounded below, there exists some sufficiently large positive integer $N$ such that for all $m \ge n \ge N$</p>

\[|x_n - x_m| &lt; |x_n|.\]

<p>Then the ultrametric triangular inequality tells us that</p>

\[|x_m| = |x_n + (x_m - x_n)| = \max\{ |x_n|, |x_m - x_n| \} = |x_n|.\]

<p>This shows that $|x| = |x_N| \in |K|$. $\quad\square$</p>

<p>By the definition, we have $|\mathbb{Q}_p| = p^{\mathbb{Z}} \cup \{0\}$ where $p^{\mathbb{Z}} \coloneqq \{ p^n : n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$.
Combining this fact with Propositoin 1, we obtain $|\overline{\mathbb{Q}_p}| = p^{\mathbb{Q}}$ where $p^{\mathbb{Q}} \coloneqq \{ p^r : r \in \mathbb{Q} \}$.
However, the Claim shows that $|\mathbb{C}_p| = p^{\mathbb{Q}} \cup {0}$, and it is easy to observe the it is a non-complete subset of $\mathbb{R}$.</p>

<p>I believe that these peculiar topological behaviors of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $\mathbb{C}_p$ are related to their total disconnectedness.
However, their less intuitive topological behaviors make room for rich algebraic techniques used for studying them.</p>

I wrote this simple post to review some linear algebra and test <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>.</p>

<p>Given finite dimensional vector spaces $U$ and $V$ over the same field $k$, let $\text{Hom}_k \,(U,V)$ denote the set of $k$-linear map (i.e. linear transformation) from $U$ to $V$. It is easy to see that $\text{Hom}_k \,(U,V)$ is itself a $k$-vector space. One might learn fun fact that we can identify $\text{Hom}_k \,(U,V)$ with the tensor product $U^\ast \otimes V$, where $U^\ast$ is the dual space of $U$ (i.e., $U^\ast = \text{Hom}_k \,(U,k)$). Precisely, there is a <strong>natural</strong> isomorphism $\phi : U^\ast \otimes V \rightarrow \text{Hom}_k \,(U,V)$ given by</p>

\[f \otimes v \longmapsto (u \mapsto f(u)v),\]

<p>for $v \in V$, $u \in U$, and $f \in U^\ast$. It is obvious that $\phi$ is a $k$-linear map. To show it is actually an isomorphism of $k$-vector spaces, we find its two-sided inverse. Let $\lbrace u_i \rbrace_{i \in I}$ be a basis for $U$ and $\lbrace u_i^\ast\rbrace_{i\in I}$ be the corresponding dual basis for $U^\ast$; that is, $u_i^\ast(u_j) \coloneqq \delta_{ij}$ where $\delta_{ij}$ is Kronecker’s delta.</p>

<p>Then we define a $k$-linear map $\psi : \text{Hom}_k \,(U,V) \rightarrow U^\ast \otimes V$ as</p>

\[g \longmapsto \sum_{i \in I}u_i^\ast \otimes g(u_i),\]

<p>for $g \in \text{Hom}_k \,(U,V)$. It is easy to check $\psi$ is actually a $k$-linear map and the two-sided inverse of $\phi$. One may feel awkward since our construction of $\psi$ seems to highly depend on the choice of $\left\{ u_i \right\}_{i \in I}$. However, surprisingly, $\psi$ is also canonical since its inverse does not depend on the choice of basis. This shows it is <strong>possible</strong> that <strong>a $k$-linear map essentially does not depend on the choice of basis, though its construction or expression involves specific elements of some basis</strong>. Otherwise, one may show expliclity that for another basis $\{t_i\}_{i \in I}$ for $U$ and the correponding dual basis $\{t_i^\ast\}_{i \in I}$, new $k$-linear map $\psi’ : \text{Hom}_k \,(U,V) \rightarrow U^\ast \otimes V$ defined using $\{t_i^\ast\}_{i \in I}$ coincide with $\psi$. It is quite hard (impossible for me) to imagine constructing a two-sided inverse of $\phi$ without dual bases. However, it does not imply $\phi$ is non-canonical.</p>

<p>Let’s move on to another example. Let $V$ be a vector space over $k$, and $V^{\otimes n} \coloneqq \underbrace{V \otimes \cdots \otimes V}_{n\text{-times}}$ and $V^{\otimes 0} \coloneqq k$. If $I = (i_1, \ldots, i_n)$ and $J = (j_1, \ldots, j_n)$ are two sequences of $n$ distinct indices from $\{1, \ldots, p\}$ and $\{1, \ldots, q\}$, respectively, we define a contraction map</p>

\[c^I_J : V^{\otimes p} \otimes (V^\ast)^{\otimes q} \longrightarrow V^{\otimes (p-n)} \otimes (V^\ast)^{\otimes (q-n)}\]

<p>which sends $v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_p \otimes f_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes f_q$ to</p>

\[\left( \prod_{\alpha=1}^n f_{j_\alpha}(v_{i_\alpha}) \right)
v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \overgroup{v_{i_1}\otimes \cdots \otimes v_{i_n}} \otimes \cdots \otimes v_p \otimes 
f_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \overgroup{f_{j_1}\otimes \cdots \otimes f_{j_n}} \otimes \cdots \otimes f_q\]

<p>where $\overgroup{\hspace{10pt}}$ means omitting the terms below. If $p=q=n$ and $I=J=(1, \ldots, n)$, then the contraction becomes a map $c : V^{\otimes n} \otimes (V^\ast)^{\otimes n} \to k$ given by</p>

\[v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_n \otimes f_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes f_n \longmapsto \prod_{\alpha =1}^n f_\alpha(v_\alpha).\]

<p>Then $c$ induces a $k$-linear map $c_\star : (V^\ast)^{\otimes n} \to (V^{\otimes n})^\ast$ defined as</p>

\[f_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes f_n \longmapsto (v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_n \mapsto c(v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_n \otimes f_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes f_n)).\]

<p>The construction of $c$ and $c_\star$ are natural. We claim that $c_\star$ is actually an isomorphism; that is, we can identify $(V^\ast)^{\otimes n}$ with $(V^{\otimes n})^\ast$ (which sounds intuitive!). Let $\{e_1, \ldots, e_m\}$ be a basis for $V$, and $\{e_1^\ast, \ldots, e_m^\ast\}$ be the corresponding dual basis for $V^\ast$. Then $\{e_{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{i_n} \}_{\underline{i} \in I^n}$ forms a basis for $V^{\otimes n}$, where $I = \{1, \ldots, m\}$ and $\underline{i} \coloneqq (i_1, \ldots, i_n) \in I^n$. We also have the correponding dual basis $\{\left(e_{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{i_n}\right)^\ast \}_{\underline{i} \in I^n}$ for $(V^{\otimes n})^\ast$. Define a $k$-linear map $d_\star : (V^{\otimes n})^\ast \to (V^\ast)^{\otimes n}$ by</p>

\[F = \sum_{\underline{i} \in I^n}\lambda_{\underline{i}}\left(e_{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{i_n}\right)^\ast \longmapsto \sum_{\underline{i} \in I^n}\lambda_{\underline{i}}e_{i_1}^\ast \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{i_n}^\ast.\]

<p>By tedious computations, one can show $d_\star$ is actually the two-sided inverse of $c_\star$. Similar to the previous example, the construction of $d_\star$ looks dependent on the choice of ${e_1, \ldots, e_n}$, but it does not in fact. Therefore, we can <strong>naturally identify</strong> $(V^{\otimes n})^\ast$ with $(V^\ast)^{\otimes n}$, though the expression of $d_\star$ involves ${e_1, \ldots, e_n}$. (Can you show that this identification may fail if $V$ is not finite-dimensional?)</p>

<p>In linear algebra, there are lots of objects with basis-free definition looking dependent to the choice of basis. Important examples taught in typical undergraduate linear algebra courses are determinant and trace. We define the determinant and trace of linear transformation $T$ using their matrix representation (i.e., using bases), but the values do not be affected by the choice of basis. Under the same philosophy, it is important to notice that a non-canonical-looking expression does not imply it is non-canonical.</p>
