Welcome to my blog! I'm an undergraduate student at [KAIST](Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) in South Korea
majoring in mathematics.

The goal of this blog is to consolidate my math knowledge and provide valuable insights into number theory and algebra. I'll be posting about various topics, including intriguing concepts, problem-solving techniques, and solutions to exercises from textbooks like Atiyah/Macdonald.
